Automate your postal ATIP/AIPRP letter to Canadian departments not supporting online requests.

ATIP Carrier Pigeon leverages [Lob](https://lob.com/), a physical mailing API, enabling journalists to easily mail, track, and coordinate correspondence from within the app.

The app supports both custom letters or auto-fills the government's [Access to Information Request Form (TBC/CTC 350-57)](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/tbsf-fsct/350-57-eng.asp) for you.

For less than the price of a Toronto TTC streetcar token, you can have a more automated ATIP experience with departments who are trapped in the 1990's (intentionally or otherwise).

#### Example cover page:

Below is an example of what the first page of a letter sent through ATIP Carrier Pigeon looks like. It is automatically generated with the proper to/from fields you specify:
